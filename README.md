# CIS 201
This is all of the projects and work I'm doing for my very first programming class, Introduction to Programming using C++!

```Block1
This is a short description and info about everything I've done
so far. Grouping things by type more than time.
```
## Projects
### Sum Product and Average
>Aug-27 This was the first project, just simply doing some math and getting used
>to making main files.
### Area and Surface Area of a Sphere
>Sept-10 This was more familiarizing ourselves with basic code, working on sqrt
### Roman Numeral Concatenation
>Sept-24 This was a tough one for me, running through each line and if else-if
>statements stumped me for a bit, and concatenating one string.
### Functions
>Oct-1 The first intro to functions, we recreated the areas and surface area formulae
>but as formal functions. There's also some review in there.
### Midterm
>Oct-15 This was a cool little project, we made a few functions to ask the user
>for a string, an character they wanted to know how many times was in the string
>then printed the number.
### Classes
>Oct-22 Classes messed me up good. They just keep stacking stuff on top of each other.
>Classes and objects took me a bit to wrap my head around, but now I see how practical
>C++ is.
**WOW**
>hopefully I keep listing and updating every project

_github is great_
