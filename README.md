# CIS 201

## Projects

### 1 Sum Product and Average
>Aug-27 This was the first project, just simply doing some math and getting used
>to making main files.

### 2 Area and Surface Area of a Sphere
>Sept-10 This was more familiarizing ourselves with basic code, working on sqrt

### 3 Roman Numeral Concatenation
>Sept-24 This was a tough one for me, running through each line and if else-if
>statements stumped me for a bit, and concatenating one string.

### 4-4.2 Functions
>Oct-1 The first intro to functions, we recreated the areas and surface area formulae
>but as formal functions. There's also some review in there.

### 4.3 Midterm
>Oct-15 This was a cool little project, we made a few functions to ask the user
>for a string, an character they wanted to know how many times was in the string
>then printed the number.

### 5-5.4 Classes
>Oct-22 Classes messed me up good. They just keep stacking stuff on top of each other.
>Classes and objects took me a bit to wrap my head around, but now I see how practical
>C++ is. 5.4 is a group project too!

### 6 Vectors and Arrays
>Nov-4 Vectors just seem like lists to me. I'm working on making a vector of objects in chapter 6.
>So far I've been working on a bank statement-type program using vectors. It's a lot more complicated than I thought!
>The bank statement project was the first huge hurdle of the class. It was fun to work on, and eventually I got it down.

### 7 Pointers
>Nov-12 Pointers are awesome, they save you so much time and memory. I'm exploring how to work with employee listings and
>bank accounts linked to them.

### 9 Streams
>Nov-27 Working with file streams. Can read info and data from .txt files and output to .txt as well.

### 9.1 Final
>Dec-3 This program is a concordance generator. It will make a list of all the words found in a text file and count of the
>number of times the word occurred, and on which lines they occurred on. I used a bit of help from <algorithm> to sort the words
>in order of times occurred, but the alternative was inefficient.
